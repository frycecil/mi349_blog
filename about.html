        <p>Hello my name is Lia Fry, I am a current student at Michigan State University studying Games and Interactive Media. I am looking to pursue a career in game development, focusing on game animation or design. I am taking MI349 mostly to expand my horizons on what options are out there. While HTML may not be specifically used in game development, it seems to be a good way to practice and get experience coding which will help me if I ever decide to get into programming. </p>
        <p>A lot of my spare time is spent practicing animating now adays, but when I am not doing that I am playing various video games or spending time with family and friends! Here are some of the games I am currently enjoying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="a">Rainbow Six Siege</li>
            <li class>Hollow Knight</li>
            <li class>Life is Strange</li>
        </ul>
