        <p>When asked what one’s favorite animal is, we tend to hear answers such as lion, or whale or dog. Today however, I want to introduce to you my favorite animal, which deserves much more attention for how awesome it is. At the same time, this blog will also stand as a public service announcement to beware the dangers of this mystical creature...</p>
        <p>The Mantis shrimp, or more specifically <em>Odontodactylus scyllarus</em> or <strong>Peacock Mantis Shrimp</strong>, are one of the most aesthetically pleasing, yet dangerous crustaceans in the ocean. While we see it for its beautiful array of colors, it hides one of the most powerful punches in the sea, striking with its claws at about 60 mph (comparable to the speed of a bullet leaving a gun). Due to the awesome power, we typically do not see Mantis shrimp in aquariums because they can punch through most glass barriers. If the punch itself misses the target, the prey could still be stunned (or even killed) by the “cavitation  bubbles”  created by the speed of the punch. Basically, the water around the punch <strong>boils</strong>.</p>
        <p>While mantis shrimp are epic for their raw power, they also have some other incredible characteristics. To put them into perspective: dogs can see two cones of color, humans seeing 3, while the mantis shrimp can perceive 16 cones of color! Not only that, but their eyes are  able to detect cancer cells due to their ability to see polarised light; studying their eyes could be extremely helpful for researchers!</p>

        </p>
        <p>A blog post you say? Sounds like an excuse for me to write about my cats! October is the best month to talk about them, they fit the aesthetic as they are all black cats! Above is a picture of all three of them, it is quite hard to get them all to sit still for one photo, so this will suffice.</p>
        <p>To start, the large lad in the middle is Shadow (yes, very stereotypical name I know, my brother and I named him when we were 10). He is the old grandpa of all the cats, and eats too much for his own good. But when he is not begging us for food, he is usually showing us love and affection with some cuddles and headbutts. This heavy boy firmly believes he is the perfect lap cat, however when we lie down he will settle upon our chest or stomachs, ultimately depriving us of air, but we love him anyway. </p>
        <p>Our second oldest is Kiki, who sits on the right in the picture. She is our greek goddess, one of the most beautiful cats I have ever seen, she could be a model if she sat still enough for pictures! While she is friendly and outgoing within our family, she is not fond of guest and new faces. She tends to hide when we have company. Compared to the other two cats, she is the only one that lets us hold her for extended periods of time; when she’s in our arms she always crosses her paws like the queen she is. My father has unfortunately encouraged her addiction to cheese, which he gives to her like treats every once in awhile…</p>
        <p>Our last cat is Mittsu, who only has 3 legs! When we were going to adopt him, he was one of the most timid and quiet cats we had ever met, but turns out it was all and act because he turned into a very rambunctious kitten. For only having three legs her sure gets around quite quick, and definitely challenges what it means to have ‘9 lives’. While he is part adventurous, he also is the biggest scaredy cat I have ever seen. He gets startled by inanimate objects, or even slight movements such as moving toes underneath a blanket. </p>
